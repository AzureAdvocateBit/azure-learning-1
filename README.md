# #100Days of Azure Learning
Jumpstarting a 2020 New Year Resolution to get knowledgeable about Azure products and services, and get at least one certification. The learning paths I am interested in checking out (in some order) are below -  course length is shown rounded up to the nearest hour.

 * [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/ml-crash-course/) - 4 hrs
 * [Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/?WT.mc_id=azurelearning-github-ninarasi) - 10 hrs
 * [Create Intelligent Bots with the Azure Bot Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/create-bots-with-the-azure-bot-service/) - 3 hrs
 * [Process and translate speech with Azure Cognitive Speech Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/translate-speech-with-speech-services/) - 2 hrs
 * [Process and classify images with the Azure Cognitive Vision Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/classify-images-with-vision-services/) - 3 hrs
 * [Evaluate text with Azure Cognitive Language Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/evaluate-text-with-language-services/) - 3 hrs
