# Azure Fundamentals

This captures notes from the [Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/?WT.mc_id=azurelearning-github-ninarasi) learning path of my #100Days pledge. To learn more about that, start with the  [README.md](README.md). 

## What do I want to accomplish?

For accountability, I created a 30-60-90 days plan that goes from building expertise to validating and sharing it with others.

 * Get familiar with the [services and features of the Azure ecosystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?WT.mc_id=azurelearning-github-ninarasi) - by *Dec 31 2020*.
 * Take (and pass) the [Azure Certification (AZ900) exam](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900?WT.mc_id=azurelearning-github-ninarasi) - by *Jan 31 2020*.
 * Build [visual guides](https://twitter.com/nitya/status/1182441502078918656) to help others navigate the Azure ecosystem - by *Mar 1 2020*


## Why do I want to do this?

As we enter the final weeks of 2019, we are seeing predictions on the demand and focus for cloud computing platforms in 2020 and beyond -- making it critical for _all_ developers and technologists to have an educated understanding of the ecosystems, and depth of expertise in some relevant topics for professional career advancement.

 * [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-11-13-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-revenue-to-grow-17-percent-in-2020) forecasts the public cloud services market will grow 17 in 2020 with SaaS being the largest segment and IaaS having the largest growth (among *aaS segments)
 * [Forrester](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forrester/2019/11/26/predictions-2020-cloud-computing-sees-new-alliances-and-new-security-concerns/#21d1f66126e2) predicts that _cloud native_ solutions will see more growth (with _service meshes_ and _serverless_ in focus) and _cloud security_ will be critical for hyperscale cloud providers and multi-cloud solutions.
 * [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/technology-industry-outlook.html) predicts cloud and AI will dominate tech headlines with edge computing (IoT) having a breakout year; hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, cloud security and cloud-powered AI are key opportunities for growth while regulatory issues (e.g., AI Ethics, Governance) will be critical areas for differentiating solutions.

As a long time technologist and community organizer, I have been more familiar with the [GCP ecosystem](https://cloud.google.com) than with [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?WT.mc_id=azurelearning-github-ninarasi) or [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com). As a technologist, I want to connect the dots across the ecosystems in my mind so I can better understand multi-cloud architectures or migration/integration needs faced by modern developers. As a community organizer, I want to collect and share resources that can help others pursue these same goals.

## How will I achieve this?

I start my #AzureFundamentals journey on **Dec 1, 2019** using these resources:

1. [The Developer's Guide to Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/campaigns/developer-guide/?WT.mc_id=azurelearning-github-ninarasi) - a free 123-page book
2. [Azure Fundamentals Learning Path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/) - 12 modules (approx. 9hrs) of free online course content
3. [The AZ900 Certification Page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) - and the [exam skills outline](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3VwUY)

I will follow this schedule and link in my notes (tips, resources) for each step in the last column.
